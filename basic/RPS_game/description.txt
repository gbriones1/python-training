Create a python rock-paper-scissors game to play against computer.

* The script should be run from a CLI.
* Ater running the program, it swould wait for user input, "r" for rock, "p" for paper, "s" for scissors, "e" for exit.
* If the user input is not valid, the program should keep asking for correct input.
* After valid user input, the program should randomly select an "r", "p" or "s".
* User's input should be compared with computer's one, and print a won/lost/drawn message.

When executing these lines, result should be as expected:

$ python game.py
Input: r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissors, e for Exit: r
You choose rock
Computer choose paper
You lose

Input: r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissors, e for Exit: s
You choose Scissors
Computer choose paper

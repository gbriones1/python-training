Create a python jumps game considering the following rules:

* The objective is to simulate a race of one player.
* The game should measure the time of the race. Try to get to the end faster.
* Player should move through a linear sequence of cells using the keys 1 and 2.
* Key 1 will move player one cell ahead.
* Key 2 will move player two cells ahead.
* The path should be generated randomly.
* Cells should contain a random number of powerup and punishment cells. (Preferably, the 40% of the spots).
* Powerups will move player forward one cell automatically.
* Punishments will move player backward one cell automatically.
* Make sure to avoid infinite loops between powerups and punishments, or that an unbeatable game is generated.
